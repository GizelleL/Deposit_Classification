# Deposit_Classification
 #### Purpose/Goal: 
 ###### Conduct a NB analysis on a bank telemarketing data set, classifying which age group will or will not purchase a term deposit

#### Results: 
Naïve Bayes is a categorical classification algorithm, often used as a benchmark against other classification algorithms. That means it can be compared to other models to determine if they are useful or not.
The confusion matrix shows a total of 3,088 predictions. There are 1,223 true negative responses, which reflect that the model correctly predicted clients that did not subscribe to term deposits (no). The 984 true positives (yes) are correct predictions for clients that actually subscribed to term deposits. The 557 false negatives are the incorrect predictions that clients will not subscribe to term deposits when in fact they did. The 324 false positives indicate incorrect predictions that a client will subscribe to a term deposit when in fact they do not. The accuracy of the models is 0.71, meaning that the overall accuracy of correctly predicting the outcome of a client’s decision is 71%. Again, Naïve Bayes is a benchmark model, so other classification models need to have higher accuracy in order to be useful.  

A ROC curve was created
